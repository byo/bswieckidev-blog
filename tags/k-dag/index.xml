      <description>Last time I brefly described the knowledge in the form of a Graph structure. Each term having set of prerequisites is a node in this graph, each dependency is a directed edge in such graph.
Now let&amp;rsquo;s assume this graph is a directed acyclic one and there are no terms which form a cycle of dependencies. In reality I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this to be true but it does simplify reasoning and can definitely be achieved locally for larger terms.</description>

      <description>If I have some specific problem to solve, I find technology that seems relevant, then I scan the Internet for some basic introduction, then some tutorial, then documentation.
My usual problem is that the issue I want to solve is usually not in the introduction nor the tutorial. I rarely find ready-to-use solution and unfortunately I tend to really dislike adjusting my idea to what you can easily achieve with tutorial-like solutions.</description>
