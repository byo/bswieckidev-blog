It compiles the code so that it runs fast, it comes with garbage collector so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with memory management, it has lightweight goroutines and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to think a lot about concurrency limits. And in majority of cases all those language constructs combined with sane defaults will be good enough. Just like writing a web server.</description></item></channel></rss>
